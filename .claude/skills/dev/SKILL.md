# NanoClaw 开发上下文

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process with skill-based channel system. Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) are skills that self-register at startup. Messages route to Claude Agent SDK running as local Node.js child processes. Each group has isolated `.claude/` config, IPC directory and filesystem.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel registry (self-registration at startup) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent as Node.js child process |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/` | Skills loaded inside agent containers (browser, status, formatting) |

## Secrets / Credentials / Proxy (OneCLI)

API keys and credentials are injected via OneCLI CLI mode (`onecli agents get-env`) or read from `.env`. Agent child processes receive only explicitly filtered environment variables via `buildLocalEnv()`. Run `onecli --help`.

## Skills

Four types of skills exist in NanoClaw. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy and guidelines.

- **Feature skills** — merge a `skill/*` branch to add capabilities (e.g. `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`)
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside SKILL.md (e.g. `/claw`)
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows, always on `main` (e.g. `/setup`, `/debug`)
- **Container skills** — synced to per-group `.claude/skills/` at agent startup (`container/skills/`)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream NanoClaw updates into a customized install |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials to it |
| `/qodo-pr-resolver` | Fetch and fix Qodo PR review issues interactively or in batch |
| `/get-qodo-rules` | Load org- and repo-level coding rules from Qodo before code tasks |

## Contributing

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, SKILL.md format rules, PR requirements, and the pre-submission checklist (searching for existing PRs/issues, testing, description format).

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript (host)
npm run build:agent  # Compile agent-runner TypeScript
```

**Security note:** Agent runs as a local child process without OS-level sandboxing. It can read/write host files (including `.env` and project source). Security relies on Claude SDK tool allowlists. Docker-based isolation is preserved in git tag `docker-runtime-v1`.

**Limitations:** Per-group agent-runner source customization is not supported — all groups share the same compiled `container/agent-runner/dist/`.

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start nanoclaw
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Troubleshooting

**WhatsApp not connecting after upgrade:** WhatsApp is now a separate skill, not bundled in core. Run `/add-whatsapp` (or `npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-whatsapp && npm run build`) to install it. Existing auth credentials and groups are preserved.

## Docker Rollback

The Docker-based container runtime has been replaced with local Node.js child processes. The complete Docker codebase is preserved in git tag `docker-runtime-v1` for rollback if needed: `git checkout docker-runtime-v1`.
